Stuff4Vaadin is a collection of classes used by many of my Vaadin addons and/or Vaadin applications
(both open source and closed source). Many of the utilities provided by this addon can be used 
outside of Vaadin applications as well.


BUILDING I18N4Vaadin
--------------------

In order to build Stuff4Vaadin, you need Java SDK 6 and Ant 1.6 or later. The other dependencies
are included in this source code repository.

Fire up a command line and execute the following command:

  $ ant all
  
This will create the add-on JAR in the build-directory.
